#
# This module has classes for  two sensors on the Raspberry Pi :
#  1. the 12 bit ADC module which in this project is used to read the pH probe.
#  2. the temperature sensor, a DS18B20 http://image.dfrobot.com/image/data/DFR0198/DS18B20.pdf
#     Using PyPI library W1ThermSensor availabe here https://pypi.org/project/w1thermsensor/
#
# Phase 1. DS18B20
# Phase 2. add MQTT client code to publish results
